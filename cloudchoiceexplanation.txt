Hi ! 
This file is about explanation on what cloud should I use, and how should I decide which cloud more efficient to use for my project, Specifically for REST API'S.

Well, apparently There are lots of different ways of approaching developing a REST API.

what should I look At is at MINIMUM, So I should consider the following:

Which Cloud provider Im using? (e.g. Google Cloud, AWS, Azure)

What platform will the API run on? (e.g. Node.js, PHP)

Will there be any underlying architectural patterns? (e.g. Serverless, Micro Services, Express)

Are there any existing frameworks that will support your development? (e.g. Serverless, Express)

There are numerous factors that may contribute to each of these decision.
Ultimately I need to look at what I'm trying to achieve and what best fits my requirements . Factors such as cost, and prior experience may restrict " which options "  are relevant to me/my project.
Generally, I can use Node.js(or JAVA) just fine on something like AWS lambda and for most REST applications I likely need some kind of data storage of some kind, so my cloud provider choice might depend on how I want to persist data.


As a result, I deeply reckon that I would use AWS lambda in my PROJECT which is the most efficient.




Hope my explanation is totally comprehended :)
